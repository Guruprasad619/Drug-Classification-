<h1><center>Welcome to Drug Classification</center></h1>

<div class="content-container">
    <div class="card">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Our drug classification model is designed to predict the most suitable drug for a patient based on their individual characteristics. This model is a demonstration of how machine learning can be applied in the field of personalized medicine to assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions about drug prescriptions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Inputs</h2>
        <p>To get a prediction, users need to provide the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Age: The patient's age in years</li>
            <li>Sex: The patient's gender (Male or Female)</li>
            <li>Blood Pressure: Categorized as High, Low, or Normal</li>
            <li>Cholesterol Level: Categorized as High or Normal</li>
            <li>Na_to_K Ratio: The ratio of Sodium to Potassium in the patient's blood</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Our model uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to make predictions. Here's a simplified explanation of the process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The model is trained on a dataset of 200 patient records, each with known characteristics and the drug that was effective for them.</li>
            <li>When a new patient's data is input, the model compares it to the known cases in the dataset.</li>
            <li>It identifies the most similar cases (nearest neighbors) based on the input characteristics.</li>
            <li>The model then predicts the drug that was most effective for these similar cases.</li>
            <li>The prediction is one of five drug types: DrugA, DrugB, DrugC, DrugX, or DrugY.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>While this model is a simplified demonstration, similar approaches in personalized medicine can have various applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personalized Treatment: Helping healthcare providers tailor medication choices to individual patient profiles.</li>
            <li>Clinical Decision Support: Assisting in the decision-making process by providing data-driven suggestions.</li>
            <li>Research: Identifying patterns in drug effectiveness across different patient demographics.</li>
            <li>Patient Education: Helping patients understand how their individual characteristics might influence treatment options.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card-full">
        <h2>Important Note</h2>
        <p>This model is for educational purposes only and should not be used for actual medical decisions. In real-world applications, much more rigorous testing, validation, and regulatory approval would be required. Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for medical advice and treatment decisions.</p>
